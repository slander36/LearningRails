LearningRails
=============

Learning Rails using ruby.railstutorial.org

###Things Learned So Far:###
1. Always reload shell after installing ANYTHING that changes config files, especially RVM and TMUX
2. You have to update app/assets/\*/application.\* to include anything you added to vendor/
3. Heroku just acts like a git repo, so working from multiple computers is as easy as using Github - just `git remote add heroku`
4. TMUX uses .bash_profile, not .bashrc, so make sure and symlink .bashrc to .bash_profile if you don't feel like renaming the file or copying the contents over every time your .bashrc is changed
